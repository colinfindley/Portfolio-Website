                            One of my most significant projects involved spending several months building Space Invaders from scratch. 
                            Throughout the project, I implemented various design patterns to ensure efficient and maintainable code.
                            I documented those design patterns used and the rationale behind their selection in a detailed Github
                            <a href="https://github.com/colinfindley/SpaceInvaders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">write-up</a>. Above is a demonstration from
                            my recreation of the game.

                            I designed and built a Video Game Engine using C++. 
                            This project showcases my proficiency in C++ and my ability to create optimized and scalable software. 
                            The engine includes advanced animation handling, a robust SIMD-optimized math library, and a 
                            complex PCS tree data structure for managing hierarchical relationships. Additionally, it features dedicated 
                            managers for meshes, cameras, and textures, showcasing my ability to manage complex systems and optimize 
                            performance across different components. This project reflects my commitment to writing efficient, maintainable 
                            code and my passion for tackling challenging technical problems. You can view the project and writeup on my

                            In an effort to tackle my own tab hoarding behavior, I developed Tabulate, a Chrome extension built with React.
                            This project demonstrates my ability to create functional and user-friendly browser extensions. 
                            Tabulate enhances tab management by allowing users to bookmark tabs, select and navigate between them,
                            close tabs, and track the time since each tab was last viewed. This project showcases my proficiency 
                            in React, state management, and user interface design, as well as my capability to address practical problems
                            with innovative solutions. You can view the project and writeup on my
